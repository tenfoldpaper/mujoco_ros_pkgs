## Unreleased

### Added
* Now it's possible to use MuJoCos intenal threadpool to speed up simulation. The number ob threads can be set with either `mujoco_threads` in the server launchfile or directly with `num_mj_threads` for the server node.
If a number above 1 is used, multithreading is enabled. MuJoCo will then use the threadpool for parallel computations in the engine itself, but also plugins may use the threadpool to dispatch tasks (via (mjTask)[https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/3.2.0/APIreference/APItypes.html#mjtask] and (mju_threadPoolEnqueue)[https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/3.2.0/APIreference/APIfunctions.html#mju-threadpoolenqueue]).
The default is `min(#available_threads - 1, 4)`.
* Added profiling of plugin load and callback execution times. For each callback an EMA with sensitivity of 1000 steps is computed. In case a plugin has lower frequency than simulation step size, the callback should set `skip_ema_ = true` when skipping computations.
Loading and reset times are reported in the server debug log. All plugin stats can be retrieved by the `get_plugin_stats` service call.
* Added ros laser plugin.
* Added dynamic reconfigure for all MuJoCo settings for fast model testing.
* Unnamed cameras don't cause crashes anymore, instead they are named `unnamed_cam_X` where is is a counting variable.
* ROS 2 (target release Humble) support!

### Fixed
* Added missing call to render callbacks in viewer. While the callbacks were still being run for offscreen rendering, the viewer did not render additional geoms added by plugins.
* *mujoco_ros_control*: fixed sometimes using wrong joint id in default hardware interface (would only be correct, if the joints appear first and in the same order in the compiled MuJoCo model).
* *mujoco_ros_sensors*: now skipping user sensors, as they should be handled in separate, dedicated plugins.
* When loading takes more than 0.25 seconds the simulation is no longer automatically paused.
* Fixed fetching of body quaternion in `get_body_state` service.
* *tests*: PendulumEnvFixture now makes sure `mj_forward` has been run at least once. This ensures the data object is populated with correct initial positions and velocities.
* Re-added services for getting and setting gravity, that somehow vanished.
* Fixed flaky tests that did not consider control callbacks being called in paused mode, too (#40).
* Fixed bug that would not allow breaking out of *as fast as possible* stepping in headless mode without shutting down the simulation.
* Fixed occasional segfault when offscreen context was freed on shutdown.
* Fixed segmented image never being rendered/published.
* Fixed thread synchronization between MujocoEnv and Viewer.
* Occasional startup hiccups with GUI mode where the rendered environment would remain empty have been fixed (race condition with loading on separate threads).
* Fixed copyright notice dates.

### Changed
* Moved `mujoco_ros::Viewer::Clock` definition to `mujoco_ros::Clock` (into common_types.h).
* Increased test coverage of `mujoco_ros_sensors` plugin.
* Split monolithic ros interface tests into more individual tests.
* Added sleeping at least until the next lowerbound GUI refresh when paused to reduce cpu load.
* deprecated `no_x` launchparameter in favor of using `no_render`, as offscreen rendering now is also available without X.
* Optimized camera render configurations where RGB, Segmented and Depth streams are active, but only Segmented and Depth are subscribed. Previously, this would result in two separate low-level render calls, now it's done in one.
* Enforced codestyle naming convention for functions (CamelCase) with exception of accessors.

## [0.9.0] - 2024-07-31

### Added
* Mocap plugin to programmatically control mocap bodies.
* Services to alter equality constraints. Note that by MuJoCo's design no new constraints can be added, though.
* The Server node now gives a more verbose error message on failure due to mismatched header and library versions.
* Service to get basic simulation state info (loaded model path, model valid, load counter, loading state, paused, pending manual steps, measured rt factor, and rt factor setting).
* Service to set the real-time factor (applies the closest available factor found in the settings).

### Fixed
* Repaired SIGINT handler callback. `C-c` in the roslaunch terminal now shuts down the MuJoCo ROS node instead of escalating to SIGTERM.
* Added actionlib to the list of mujoco_ros' dependencies.
* Updated CI actions (#33).
* Fixed linking order for mujoco_ros_mocap tests (#33).
* Fixed glx BadAccess error on exit when running with GUI.
* Fixed bug where stepping multiple times to get up to speed with the desired realtime factor would only happen if a viewer was attached.
* Enabling and disabling model flags in the GUI's 'Physics' tab is now applied to the attached environment.

### Changed
* replaced `boost::shared_ptr` with `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr` wherever possible (ROS 1 fast intra-process message-passing requires boost::shared_ptr).
* replaced `shared_ptr` with `unique_ptr` wherever possible.
* replaced smart pointer constructor initialization with `make_shared` or `make_unique` wherever possible.
* Updated to MuJoCo library version 3.2.0.
* * VFS now only saves models provided as strings. Model loading and caching might change once the `mjSpec` API is more stable and better documented.
* * Added [jointactuatorfrc](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.7/XMLreference.html#sensor-jointactuatorfrc) support in `mujoco_ros_sensors`.
* Updated to clang-tidy-14 (default on jammy).
* Added catkin_lint to pre-commit (i.e. format workflow).
* Introduced helper function to validate service call permissions in evaluation mode.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-10-23

### Added
* Manual steps now run as fast as possbile. I.e., if a viewer is connected, stepping is interrupted to render the UI at 30Hz. (This now also applies to running with unbound real-time, which previously was interrupted at 30Hz regardless if any viewer was connected).
* Added GitHub Actions for building docker images, CI, and formatting based on MoveIt's configuration (#30).

### Fixed
* re-added setting realtime settings via ros param or in the mujoco model xml.
* Add missing install of mujoco_ros's `config` and `assets` directories (#28).
* Added missing example config for `mujoco_ros_sensors`.
* Fixed catkin lint errors (#31).
* Resolved clang-tidy warnings.

### Changed
* Reduced sensor noise std in tests to reduce wrongful fails due to too stochasticity.
* Updated toplevel README to be more informative.
* mujoco_ros_control & mujoco_ros_sensors have a Sanitize build type (#31).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### Breaking Changes
> * `MujocoPlugin::node_ptr_` now is a NodeHandle instead of a NodeHandlePtr.
> * MujocoPlugin callbacks now use raw pointers to mjModel and mjData instead of shared pointers in their callbacks (mjModel is even const, thus calls to functions like `mj_id2name` that expect a non-const mjModel pointer need a `const_cast<mjModel *>` to not throw compile errors).

* * `MujocoSim::detail` -> moved mostly to private access members, namespace is not necessary anymore.
* * `MujocoSim::jointName2id` -> `mujoco_ros::util::jointName2id`.
* Node launchfile arg changed from `visualize` to `headless` for consistency.
* Moved most contents of `MujocoSim::rendering::VisualStruct` into `mujoco_ros::MujocoEnv::offscreen`.
* Renamed `MujocoSim::rendering::CameraStream` -> `mujoco_ros::rendering::OffscreenCamera`.
* `env_id` members were removed from messages, since env_ids are no longer used.
* Added more compiler warnings (see [CompilerWarnings.cmake](./cmake/CompilerWarnings.cmake)).
